## How It's Made:

A web application that calls a cocktail API using an asynchronous fetch function that displays cocktail information after a search is performed. Users can then cycle through an array of cocktails that match that search parameter. Entry into the cocktail app requires a password and allows entry based on a conditional. 


## Optimizations

Further optimizations include searching for cocktails by their ingredients. Using local storage to enable users to save a list of their favorite cocktails. 


## Lessons Learned:

- [x] Further understanding of object manipulation through API responses
- [x] JavaScript window.scrollTo method
- [x] Learnt more about asynchronous functions and their benefits
- [x] Learnt how to make a Tequila Sunrise
